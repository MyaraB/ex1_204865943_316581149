Project ex1 is made up of 3 interfaces and 3 classes.
the class NodeInfo is a class withing WGraph_DS

this project mainly focuses on weighted graphs.
we are able to create nodes, weighted graphs and weighted graph algo.
the edges between two nodes stores a Double value.

we are able to get and set node info,tags. we are able to add and remove nodes to graphs.
we can also connect or disconnect two nodes with an edge.
by using the weighted graph algo we can find the shortest distance between two graphs and can also get the exact
list of nodes in the shortest path from node a to b.
